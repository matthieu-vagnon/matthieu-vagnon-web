That said, I'm firmly convinced that AI should serve as an augmentation tool rather than operate as a fully autonomous agent. I also believe that AI is not yet mature enough for creative tasks—which is why I don't rely on it when designing interfaces or refining existing user experiences. Human creativity and judgment remain irreplaceable in these areas."

        },
        "3": {
          "question": "Why me and not someone else?",
          "answer": "Because I'm a rare profile, combining technical ability, knowledge of AI assistants, great creativity, and perfectionism. Entrusting me with your project means ensuring that it will follow a clear direction and remain faithful to your expectations."
